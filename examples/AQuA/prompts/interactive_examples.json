    "input": "Given a multiple choice question and all the options, please decompose the question into sub-questions. For each sub-question, please answer it in a complete sentence, ending with \"The answer is\". When the original question is answerable, please go through all the options and find the best option that is closest to the answer, start the subquestion with \"Now we can answer the question: \", ending with \"The answer is\".\n\nQuestion 1:Find out which of the following values is the multiple of X, if it is divisible by 9 and 12?, options: [A)36, B)15, C)17, D)5, E)7].\nQuestion 1.1: What are the common multiples of 9 and 12?\nAnswer 1.1: The common multiples of 9 and 12 include numbers like 36, 72, 108, etc. The least common multiple is 36. The answer is 36.\nQuestion 1.2: Now we can answer the question:which of the following is divisible by 9 and 12.\nAnswer 1.2: Option A) 36 is a multiple of both 9 and 12, and it matches the least common multiple. Options B) 15, C) 17, D) 5, and E) 7 are not multiples of both 9 and 12, so they are not valid options. The answer is A.\n\nQuestion 2: Which of the following numbers is the smallest prime number greater than 100?, options: [A)101, B)103, C)105, D)107, E)109]. \nQuestion 2.1: What is a prime number? \nAnswer 2.1: A prime number is a number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. \nQuestion 2.2: Are there any numbers between 100 and 110 that are not prime? \nAnswer 2.2: Yes, numbers like 100, 102, 104, 105, 106, 108, and 110 are not prime because they have divisors other than 1 and themselves. \nQuestion 2.3: Which of the given options is a prime number? \nAnswer 2.3: Among the options, 101, 103, 107, and 109 are prime numbers. \nQuestion 2.4: Now we can answer the question: which of the options is the smallest prime number greater than 100? \nAnswer 2.4: Option A) 101 is the smallest prime number greater than 100, so the answer is A.\n\nQuestion 3: A salesperson gets a 10% commission on each sale he makes. How many sales of $250 each must he make in order to reach a salary of at least $1000?, options: [A)15, B)24, C)25, D)40, E)52]. \nQuestion 3.1: What is the commission amount for a single sale of $250, given that the commission rate is 10%? \nAnswer 3.1: The commission for a single sale of $250 at a rate of 10% is $25. The answer is $25. \nQuestion 3.2: How many sales of $250 each are needed to reach a total commission of $1000? \nAnswer 3.2: To reach a total commission of $1000, the salesperson must make $1000 / $25 = 40 sales. The answer is 40. \nQuestion 3.3: Now we can answer the question: How many sales of $250 each must the salesperson make in order to reach a salary of at least $1000? \nAnswer 3.3: The salesperson must make 40 sales of $250 each to reach a salary of at least $1000. The answer is D.\n\nQuestion 4: I know a 5-digit number having a property that with a 1 after it, it is three times as large as it would be with a 1 before it. What is that number?, options: [A)42857, B)32456, C)76523, D)24567, E)43566]. \nQuestion 4.1: What does the given property mean in mathematical terms? \nAnswer 4.1: The property means that if the number is N, then N * 10 + 1 = 3 * (100000 + N). The answer is an equation representing the property. \nQuestion 4.2: What is the value of N that satisfies the equation? \nAnswer 4.2: By solving the equation N * 10 + 1 = 3 * (100000 + N), we find that N = 42857. The answer is 42857. \nQuestion 4.3: Now we can answer the question: What is the 5-digit number that has the given property? \nAnswer 4.3: The 5-digit number that has the given property is 42857. The answer is A.\n\n",
