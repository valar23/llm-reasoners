    "input": "Given a question, please decompose it into sub-questions. For each sub-question, please answer it in a complete sentence, ending with \"The answer is\". When the original question is answerable, please start the subquestion with \"Now we can answer the question: \".\n\nQuestion 1: Find all numbers $a$ for which the graph of $y=x^2+a$ and the graph of $y=ax$ intersect. Express your answer in interval notation.\nQuestion 1.1:What is the equation for intersection?\nAnswer 1.1: The property of intersectionality can be satisfied by setting the two equations equal to each other, ie. $x^2+a=ax$. The answer is $x^2+a=ax$.\nQuestion 1.2: How to ensure that the equation $x^2+a=ax$ has a solution?\nAnswer 1.2: For an equation to have a solution, the discriminant must be non negative, so $a^2-4a>=0$. The answer is $a^2-4a>=0$.\nQuestion 1.3: What are possible $a$ values?\nAnswer 1.3: The equation can be simplified to $a(a-4)>=0$, this quadratic (in $a$) is nonnegative when $a$ is in (-infinity,0] or [4, infinity). The answer is (-infinity,0] or [4, infinity).\nQuestion 1.4: Now we can answer the question: what are all numbers of $a$ that two graphs intersect?\nAnswer 1.4: The values of $a$ are (-infinity,0] or [4, infinity). The answer is (-infinity,0] or [4, infinity).\n\nQuestion 2: A ball travels on a parabolic path in which the height (in feet) is given by the expression $-25t^2+75t+24$, where $t$ is the time after launch. At what time is the height of the ball at its maximum?\nQuestion 2.1: What is the height equation?\nAnswer 2.1: The equation for the height of the ball over time is $-25t^2+75t+24$. The answer is $-25t^2+75t+24$. \nQuestion 2.2: Where is the maximum height?\nAnswer 2.2: The general expression is $at^2+bt+c$. The answer is $at^2+bt+c$.\nQuestion 2.3: What time is the maximum height?\nAnswer 2.3: The vertex of this general expression is the maximum height, which can be expressed as $-b/(2a)$, in this case, $-75/(2*25)=\\frac{3}{2}$. The answer is $\\frac{3}{2}$. \nQuestion 2.4: Now we can answer the question: At what time is the height of the ball at its maximum?\nAnswer 2.4: The ball reaches the maximum height at the vertex, which is $\\frac{3}{2}$. The answer is $\\frac{3}{2}$. \n\nQuestion 3:You have a square that has a side length of $1$ centimeter. Each minute, $2$ centimeters are added to the side length. After $10$ minutes, what will be the difference between the area of the last square and the area of the initial square in square centimeters (do not include the units in your answer)?\nQuestion 3.1: What is the side length after 10 minutes?\nAnswer 3.1: Given that $2$ centimeter are added to the side length of the square for every minute, after $10$ minutes the side length will be $1$ centimeter (initial side length) + 10 minutes * 2 centimeter/minute = 21 centimeter. The answer is 21.\nQuestion 3.2: What is the area of the square after 10 minutes?\nAnswer 3.2:The area of the square after 10 minutes is the square of the side length. Given the side length is $21$ centimeters, the area is $21^2 = 441$ square centimeters. The answer is 441.\nQuestion 3.3: What is the area of the initial square?\nAnswer 3.3: The area of the square initially is the square of the side length. Given the side length is $1$ centimeters, the area is $1^2 = 1$ square centimeters. The answer is $1$.\nQuestion 3.4: Now we can answer the question:What is the area difference?\nAnswer 3.4: The difference in the area is $441$ square centimeters - $1$ square centimeters = $440$ square centimeters. The answer is 440\\text{ cm}^2. \n\nQuestion 4: My baseball team won $2/9$ of its games this season.  If we lost 15 more games than we won, how many games did we play this year?\nQuestion 4.1: How to represent the won games?\nAnswer 4.1: If there’s $x$ total number of games, the number of won games is $(2/9)x = 2x/9$ games. The answer is $2x/9$.\nQuestion 4.2: How to represent the lost games?\nAnswer 4.2: There’s $x$ total number of games and $2x/9$ total wins, so $x - 2x/9 = 7x/9$ games were lost. The answer is $7x/9$. \nQuestion 4.3: What is the equation for losing 15 more games than winning?\nAnswer 4.3:Since the number of wins is $2x/9$ and the number of losses is $7x/9$, so the equation is $2x/9 = 7x/9 -15$, Simplifying the equation gives $x/9 = 3$. \nQuestion 4.4: Now we can answer the question: what is the total number of games played this year?\nAnswer 4.4:solving the equation $x/9 = 3$ gives $x = 27$, so a total of 27 games played this year. The answer is 27. \n\n",
